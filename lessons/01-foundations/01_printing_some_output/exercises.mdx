## Recap Questions

<details>
  <summary>What is the syntax for representing human speech in JavaScript?</summary>

We use **strings**, for instance `'To be or not to be'`, `'Ophelia'`, `"It's time to go!"`.

Strings are enclosed either in **single quotes** or **double quotes**. Double quotes are useful if  you need to include single quotes or apostrophes in the string itself.

  <summary>How do we print out information in JavaScript?</summary>

With `console.log`, like:

```js
console.log('The sum of 2 and 3 is', 2 + 3);
```

  <summary>What happens if we forget to close the parenthesis after `console.log`?</summary>

The machine won't know how to parse your code, and will generate an output of the following kind:

```
'SyntaxError: /index.js: Unexpected token, expected , (2:0)
```

  <summary>How do you perform mathematical operations in JavaScript?</summary>

// ** output **
