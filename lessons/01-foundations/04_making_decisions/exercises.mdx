### Guess the secret word

Write a function called `guessSecretWord` that takes a word as a parameter. The function should log "You guessed right!" if the word is `'s3cr3t'`, and "Not even close." otherwise.

Write two or more function calls with appropriate arguments that test if the code works fine.

```js static showConsole
function guessSecretWord(guess) {
  if (guess == 's3cr3t') {
    console.log('You guessed right!');
  } else {
    console.log('Not even close.');
  }
}

guessSecretWord('Abracadabra');
guessSecretWord('Hocus Pocus');
guessSecretWord('s3cr3t');
// ** output **
'Not even close.'
'Not even close.'
'You guessed right!'
```

### Deciding what to do tonight

Write a function called `showPlans` with three parameters - two strings that represent the plans for the evening, and the time of the day as a number.

- if the passed time is later than 20, log "It's too late, I will \{ the second plan \}";
- else, log "I have plenty of time, I will \{ the first plan \}".

Write two or more function calls with appropriate arguments that test if the code works fine.

  <summary>Possible solution</summary>
```js static showConsole
function showPlans(planA, planB, time) {
  if (time > 20) {
    console.log("It's too late, I will", planB);
  } else {
    console.log('I have plenty of time, I will', planA);
  }
}

showPlans('go to the gym', 'watch a movie', 22);
showPlans('go to the gym', 'watch a movie', 18);
// ** output **
//It's too late, I'll watch a movie
//I have plenty of time, I'll go to the gym
```  
</details>

Bonus: make the function take a fourth parameter that defines when the late time starts, and use it inside the function accordingly.

  <summary>Possible solution</summary>
```js static showConsole
function showPlans(planA, planB, time, lateAfter) {
  if (time > lateAfter) {
    console.log("It's too late, I will", planB);
  } else {
    console.log('I have plenty of time, I will', planA);
  }
}

showPlans('go to the gym', 'watch a movie', 22, 21);
showPlans('go to the gym', 'watch a movie', 18, 21);
// ** output **
//It's too late, I'll watch a movie
//I have plenty of time, I'll go to the gym
