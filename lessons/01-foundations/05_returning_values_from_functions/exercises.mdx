## Recap Questions

<details>
  <summary>Do all functions need to return something?</summary>

Not at all, for instance they can just `console.log` something.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can we check what a function returns?</summary>

With the aid of `console.log`, like:

```js static showConsole
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log('The sum of 2 and 3 is', sum(2, 3));
// ** output **
// The sum of 2 and 3 is 5
```

## Exercises

### Average of two numbers

Write a function called `getAverage` that takes two numbers as parameters, and returns their average value (i.e. the half of their sum).

Call the function three times with different arguments, and check if your expectation is met.

**Important**: the function does not need to log anything.

  <summary>Possible solution</summary>

```js static showConsole
function getAverage(a, b) {
  return (a + b) / 2;
}

console.log(getAverage(2, 3));
console.log(getAverage(10, 20));
console.log(getAverage(5, -5));
// ** output **
2.5
15
0
```
</details>

### Max of two numbers

Write a function called `max` that takes two numbers as parameters, and returns the greater of the two.

Hint: you can use the `return` keyword inside an `if` block.

Call the function three times with different arguments, and check if your expectation is met.

**Important**: the function does not need to log anything.

<details>
  <summary>Possible solution</summary>

```js static showConsole
function max(a, b) {
  if (a > b) {
    return a;
  }
  return b;
}

console.log(max(2, 3));
console.log(max(20, 10));
console.log(max(5, -5));
// ** output **
3
20
5
```
