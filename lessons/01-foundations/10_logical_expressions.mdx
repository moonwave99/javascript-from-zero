# Logical expressions

We have come a long way so far: we know about different **data types** (numbers, strings, booleans), we know about **functions**, their **parameters** and how to call them with **approriate arguments**. We know about group information in **objects** and how to access the values stored in their keys.

We learnt to take some decisions with **if statements**. We have just seen a couple of use cases without too much rigor: do you remember the `greet` function?

```js static showConsole
function greet(person, time) {
  if (time > 12) {
    console.log("Good afternoon", person);
  } else {
    console.log("Good morning", person);
  }
}

greet('Charlie Brown', 9);
greet('Charlie Brown', 15);
// ** output **
'Good morning Charlie Brown'
'Good afternoon Charlie Brown'
```

We have a different behaviour fepending on what second argument we used to call the function.

Then we checked the presence of an object key in the `printUserInfo` function:

```js static showConsole
function printUserInfo(user) {
  console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
  console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
  console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
  if (user.address) {
    console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
  }
}

printUserInfo(myUser);
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 7 of Sesame Street'
```

We have a grasp of how an if statement behaves. But how does the language decide if the condition is met?

## Boolean expressions

We already encountered the **boolean type**. It's a data type that can hold just two values: `true` and `false`. They are just commodity names: they could have called them _yes_ and _no_, or use the numbers 1 and 0.

We can use boolean values directly in conditions like:

```js static showConsole
const isRaining = true;

if (isRaining) {
  console.log("I'd better carry an umbrella with me")
} else {
  console.log("It's good to be hands free")
}
// ** output **
"I'd better carry an umbrella with me"
```

The language checks whether the passed value is `true` or `false` and behaves consequently. But we haven't passed boolean values before, e.g. `if (time > 12) { ... }`, why is that possible.

The fact is that **everything in JavaScript can be associated to a true or false value in a conditional context**. This concept is called to evaluate the **truthiness** (or **falsiness**) of a value, even though it is not strictly of the boolean type. This allows us to write more concise if statements, that otherwise would require very tedious comparisons.

## Concrete use cases

One could compute the truthiness / falsiness of all possible values and expressions, but that wouldn't be much useful out of context. Let's instead discuss some concrete use cases.

### Comparing strings

It's very useful to see if some string value matches some other. For instance let's write a function that checks if we passed the secret word:

```js static showConsole
function guessSecretWord(guess) {
  if (guess == 's3cr3t') {
    console.log('You guessed right!');
  } else {
    console.log('Not even close.');
  }
}

guessSecretWord('Abracadabra');
guessSecretWord('Hocus Pocus');
guessSecretWord('s3cr3t');
// ** output **
'Not even close.'
'Not even close.'
'You guessed right!'
```

Please ignore for a second that the secret word is in plain sight. The function is called with an argument called `guess`. The if statement compares it with a string whose value is `s3cr3t` thanks to the **comparison operator** (`==`), written with **two equal signs**.

Let's write some log statements to see what the comparison operator does:

```js static showConsole
console.log('cat' == 'dog');
console.log('cat' == 'Cat');
console.log('cat' == 'cat');
// ** output **
false
false
true
```

- comparing two completely different strings evaluates to `false`;
- comparing two strings that differ just by case evaluates to `false`;
- comparing two strings that match in content and case evaluates to `true`.

This is what gets evaluated in the if statement of the `guessSecretWord` function.

:::important Note
If using two equals sign was not enough, we'll soon see that a **triple equals sign** is often used in the same context. Let's definitely not discuss this now.

### Comparing numbers

We have already seen the **greater than operator** (`>`). Let's see a sample of possible numeric comparisons:

```js static showConsole
console.log('2 > 3', 2 > 3);
console.log('2 < 3', 2 < 3);
console.log('2 >= 3', 2 >= 3);
console.log('2 >= 2', 2 >= 2);
console.log('2 <= 3', 2 <= 3);
console.log('2 <= 2', 2 <= 2);
console.log('2 == 3', 2 == 3);
console.log('2 == 2', 2 == 2);
// ** output **
'2 > 3', false
'2 < 3', true
'2 >= 3', false
'2 >= 2', true
'2 <= 3', true
'2 <= 2', true
'2 == 3', false
'2 == 2', true
```

Looks like a lot of stuff, but it just maps all possible cases:

| Symbol | Name                   |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| `>`    | Greater than           |
| `>`    | Lesser than            |
| `>=`   | Greather than or equal |
| `<=`   | Lesser than or equal   |
| `==`   | Equals                 |

:::important Note
The comparison operator is used to compare both strings and numbers. It is actually used to compare a string to a number as well! But we don't want to discuss this here.
