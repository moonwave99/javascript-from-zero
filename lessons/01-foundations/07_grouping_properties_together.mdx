# Grouping properties together

In the [previous lesson](./storing_intermediate_values) we have seen how to store information in variables. We continued our journey in calculating the discounted prices of snacks of questionable nutrition score and ended up with the following code:

```js static
const originalPriceOfNachos = 50;
const originalPriceOfSoda = 20;
const discountOfNachos = 10;
const discountOfSoda = 20;

function getDiscountedPrice(price, discount) {
  return price * (100 - discount) / 100;
}

const priceOfNachos = getDiscountedPrice(originalPriceOfNachos, discountOfNachos);
const priceOfSoda = getDiscountedPrice(originalPriceOfSoda, discountOfSoda);

console.log('The price for the nachos is', priceOfNachos);
console.log('The price for the soda is', priceOfSoda);

console.log(
  'The total for the nachos and the soda is',
  priceOfNachos + priceOfSoda
);
// ** output **
'The price for the nachos is', 45
'The price for the soda is', 16
'The total for the nachos and the soda is', 61
```

This would probably give the itch to experienced programmers. But we are not there yet and we absolutely have a lot of to cover in our journey.

The problem starts at the very beginning, where we declare the four variables:

```js
const originalPriceOfNachos = 100;
const originalPriceOfSoda = 30;
const discountOfNachos = 20;
const discountOfSoda = 50;
```

Imagine adding a third product:

```js
const originalPriceOfNachos = 100;
const originalPriceOfSoda = 30;
const originalPriceOfWater = 10;
const discountOfNachos = 20;
const discountOfSoda = 50;
const discountOfWater = 10;
```

Please stop! What about the following:

```js static
const nachos = {
  price: 100,
  discount: 20
};

const soda = {
  price: 30,
  discount: 50
};

function getDiscountedPrice(price, discount) {
  return price * (100 - discount) / 100;
}

const priceOfNachos = getDiscountedPrice(nachos.price, nachos.discount);
const priceOfSoda = getDiscountedPrice(soda.price, soda.discount);

console.log('The price for the nachos is', priceOfNachos);
console.log('The price for the soda is', priceOfSoda);

console.log(
  'The total for the nachos and the soda is',
  priceOfNachos + priceOfSoda
);
// ** output **
'The price for the nachos is', 80
'The price for the soda is', 15
'The total for the nachos and the soda is', 95
```

[insert Drake meme here] Now we are talking! The output of the program stayed the same again, but we introduced a new syntax that helped us group information together.

## Objects in JavaScript

We just went from storing four numbers in four different variables, i.e:

```js
const originalPriceOfNachos = 100;
const originalPriceOfSoda = 30;
const discountOfNachos = 20;
const discountOfSoda = 50;
```

to just two variables, `nachos` and `soda`:

```js
const nachos = {
  price: 100,
  discount: 20
};

const soda = {
  price: 30,
  discount: 50
};
```

These two are your first two **JavaScript objects**. An object is **a collection of related data and/or functionality**. For now we'll deal with data only.

:::important Good to know
- `price` and `discount` are **the object keys** or properties;
- we'll refer to them as key or properties in an interchangeable manner;
- each object key holds a **value**, in this case the numbers coming after the colon (`:`);
- the list of key / value pairs should be comma separated;
- an object can have as many key / value pairs as you want;
- you can access the value for a given key with the **dot notation** - e.g. `nachos.price`, `nachos.discount`;
- in order to use the dot notation, you have to know the name of the variable containing the object, and the name of the key you are interested in.
:::

## Reading object values

Object represent composite pieces of information. Let's have a break from our sodas and practice this new syntax a little.

```js static showConsole
const user = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35
};

console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
```

We created an object with four properties (`firstName`, `lastName`, `email` and `age`) and stored it into a variable called `user`.

Right after that we logged some information from the `user` with the aid of the **dot notation**,  
i.e. `{name of the object variable}.{name of the key we need}`.

:::important Note
Object theory in JavaScript goes way beyond this. But key/value definition and dot notation is their main purpose and what you should get used to from the very beginning.

## Yes and no: the boolean type

We have stored strings and numbers in our objects so far, that works great for quantities and descriptive properties. What about saving if a user has verified account? One could depict this in a string, but there are more practical ways of handling this.

```js static showConsole
const user = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  isVerified: true
};

console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
if (user.isVerified) {
  console.log('My account is verified!');
}
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'My account is verified!'
```

We briefly encountered the `true` and `false` values when we logged some number comparisons expressions:

```js static showConsole
console.log('2 > 3', 2 > 3);
console.log('2 < 3', 2 < 3);
// ** output **
'2 > 3', false
'2 < 3', true
```

`true` and `false` are called **boolean values**. They describe something that can have just two possible states. A user is either verified or not. The sun is either shining or it is hiding behind clouds. A person can be of major age or not in a specific jurisdiction. An integer number is either even or odd.

We fed the `isVerified` property of the `user` object as the condition of an **if statement**. Boolean values and conditional are really meant to work together!

See also that there is no `else` block following the `if` block. If we don't want to log anything in case the user is not verified, we don't have to provide an alternative behavior of our program.

In case we wanted though, we could do it:

```js static showConsole
const user = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  isVerified: false
};

console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
if (user.isVerified) {
  console.log('My account is verified!');
} else {
  console.log('Chances are that I am not the real', user.firstName, user.lastName);
}
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'Chances are that I am not the real Jane Doe'
```

See how now just the `else` branch is executed, since `user.isVerified` is false.

## Flipping the question
We are checking if the user is verified. What if we want to check if the user _is not verified_?

```js static showConsole
const user = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  isVerified: false
};

console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
if (!user.isVerified) {
  console.log('My account is not verified!');
}
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'My account is not verified!'
```
The conditional expression changed to `if (!user.isVerified)`. We prepended an exclamation mark to `user.isVerified`. The `!` is called the **negation operator** and it is read "not". It takes whatever follows it, and flips its value to false if it was true and viceversa.

The negation operator works also with non boolean values. We'll see how when we'll cover conditional logic in a more formal way.

:::important Note
Boolean values can appear not just as values for object keys, but as **function call arguments** and **variable values** as well:

```js static showConsole
function getClothes(isRaining) {
  if (isRaining) {
    return 'jacket';
  } else {
    return 't-shirt'
  }
}

const isRainingToday = true;
const isRainingTomorrow = false;

console.log("Given the weather of today, I'll wear a", getClothes(isRainingToday));
console.log("Given the weather of tomorrow, I'll wear a", getClothes(isRainingTomorrow));
// ** output **
"Given the weather of today, I'll wear a jacket"
"Given the weather of tomorrow, I'll wear a t-shirt"
```
