# Internal variables

So far we declared variables just outside of any function. Nobody prevents us from doing so from within of them, and now we'll learn why it's useful.

## Keeping count of things

We want to give our users some feedback about their profile information, and tell them what they can improve. To keep things simple let's take in consideration just three properties: `name`, `age` and `email`, that can all be or not he there.

We have to display a message like `0/3`, `2/3`, `3/3`.

Let's draft the function signature and some test calls:

```js
function checkProfileProgress(user) {
  // work in progress
}

const myUser = {
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35
};

const mysteriousUser = {
  name: 'John Doe'
};

checkProfileProgress(myUser);
checkProfileProgress(mysteriousUser);
```

In real life we keep track of quantities with fingers or by ticking lines on paper. Both methods have in common the concept of **updating something**. So far we have declared variables that didn't need to be updated, that why they are introduced by the `const` keyword.

There is another keyword that allows us to overwrite the contents of a variable: it's called `let`:

```js static showConsole
const user = {
  name: 'John Doe'
};

let count = 0;

if (user.name) {
  count = count + 1;
}

console.log('Count:', count);
// ** output **
// Count: 1
```

The initial value of `count` is 0. The condition of the if statement is satisfied and its block is executed. The only instruction contained overwrites `count` with one plus whatever it has at the moment, `count = count + 1`. The log statement at the end reflects the updated value of the `count` variable, that is now 1. Now we can use this inside our function!

:::important Note
### The increment and decrement operators

An expression like `count = count + 1;` is absolutely fine and easy to understand. In programming it's more idiomatic to use the **increment operator** (`++`). It's an unary operator that is written after the variable you want to increment by one (and by one only!):

```js static showConsole
let count = 0;
// it's exactly like writing 'count = count + 1'
count++;
console.log(count);
// ** output **
1
```

There is the **decrement operator** too:

```js static showConsole
let count = 1;
// it's exactly like writing 'count = count - 1'
count--; 
console.log(count);
// ** output **
0
```

Both operators actually work even if _prepended_ to the variable, but they have a different behavior that we don't want to discuss now.
:::

We'll use the increment operator to make things more idiomatic. If you prefer the explicit notation feel free to use it in your personal code for now. 

```js static showConsole
function checkProfileProgress(user) {
  let count = 0;

  if (user.name) {
    // like count = count + 1;
    count++;
  }

  if (user.age) {
    count++;
  }

  if (user.email) {
    count++;
  }

  console.log(`${count}/3`);
}

const myUser = {
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35
};

const mysteriousUser = {
  name: 'John Doe'
};

checkProfileProgress(myUser);
checkProfileProgress(mysteriousUser);

// ** output **
// 3/3
// 1/3
```

Great! We are checking the properties one by one, and if they have found we update the count accordingly.

## Declaration, assignation, initialization

Now that we know about the `let` keyword we can finally give the following rigorous definitions about variables.

### Declaration

**To declare a variable** is to just give it a name:

```js
let name;
```

Exactly, with no equals anything after that! We had to wait until getting acquainted to `let`, because doing with `const` would result into an error:

```js live showConsole
const name;
```

Since we cannot update values declared with `const`, it makes no sense to declare them with no value.
You seldom just declare variables with no value at all. There are scenarios but are not so common.

### Assignation

If a variable was declared with `let`, you can update it:

```js
let count = 0;

if (someCondition) {
  count = count = 1;
}
```

We say that we **assign a new value** to the `count` variable. Again, it doesn't work with `const`:

```js live showConsole
const count = 0;

if (someCondition) {
  count = count = 1;
}
```

### Initialization

If you already know the initial value of your variable you can do both operations together. This is called **to initialize the variable**:

```js
const user = { name: 'Charlie Brown' };
let count = 0;
```

## `let` vs. `const`

Why haven't we discussed both possibilities at the same time? Because that would have been just confusing, since you will never declare or declare a variable and overwrite its value in the very next line! Let's review the two concepts with some examples.

- a variable can be declared with both the `const` and `let` keywords.
- an mere declaration with `const` is not possible (e.g. `const name;`), because we cannot assign anything to it later;
- variables declared by `let` allow later assignations.

```js
✅ const daysOfTheWeek = 7;
✅ let visitedCountriesCount = 10;

❌ const monthsOfTheYear;   // no mere declaration with const
❌ daysOfTheWeek = 5;       // no assignation with const
```

When to use one or another? Easy: **always use `const`**, unless you plan to update the variable later. `let` is used for counters, building strings incrementally, and more generally when some condition is involved.

:::important Note
The `const` and `let` keywords have been introduced in the [ECMAScript 2015][ecmascript-2015] revision of the language. Before there was just a single way to declare variables that always allowed further changes, and that was with the `var` keyword:

```js static showConsole
var myAge = 40;
// I changed my mind
myAge = 25;
console.log('My age is:', myAge);
// ** output **
// My age is: 25
```

Since then we don't use `var` anymore, but you may still stumble upon legacy code that uses that.
