# Internal variables

So far we declared variables just outside of any function. Nobody prevents us from doing so from within of them, and now we'll learn why it's useful.

## Keeping count of things

We want to give our users some feedback about their profile information, and tell them what they can improve. To keep things simple let's take in consideration just three properties: `name`, `age` and `email`, that can all be or not he there.

We have to display a message like `0/3`, `2/3`, `3/3`.

Let's draft the function signature and some test calls:

```js
function checkProfileProgress(user) {
  // work in progress
}

const myUser = {
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35
};

const mysteriousUser = {
  name: 'John Doe'
};

checkProfileProgress(myUser);
checkProfileProgress(mysteriousUser);
```

In real life we keep track of quantities with fingers or by ticking lines on paper. Both methods have in common the concept of **updating something**. So far we have declared variables that didn't need to be updated, that why they are introduced by the `const` keyword.

There is another keyword that allows us to overwrite the contents of a variable: it's called `let`:

```js static showConsole
const user = {
  name: 'John Doe'
};

let count = 0;

if (user.name) {
  count = count + 1;
}

console.log('Count:', count);
// ** output **
// Count: 1
```

The initial value of `count` is 0. The condition of the if statement is satisfied and its block is executed. The only instruction contained overwrites `count` with one plus whatever it has at the moment, `count = count + 1`. The log statement at the end reflects the updated value of the `count` variable, that is now 1.

Now we can use this inside our function!

```js static showConsole
function checkProfileProgress(user) {
  let count = 0;

  if (user.name) {
    count = count + 1;
  }

  if (user.age) {
    count = count + 1;
  }

  if (user.email) {
    count = count + 1;
  }

  console.log(`${count}/3`);
}

const myUser = {
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35
};

const mysteriousUser = {
  name: 'John Doe'
};

checkProfileProgress(myUser);
checkProfileProgress(mysteriousUser);

// ** output **
// 3/3
// 1/3
```

Great! We are checking the properties one by one, and if they have found we update the count accordingly.

## Declaration, assignation, initialization

Now that we know about the `let` keyword we can finally give the following rigorous definitions about variables.

### Declaration

**To declare a variable** is to just give it a name:

```js
let name;
```

Exactly, with no equals anything after that! We had to wait until getting acquainted to `let`, because doing with `const` would result into an error:

```js live showConsole
const name;
```

Since we cannot update values declared with `const`, it makes no sense to declare them with no value.
You seldom just declare variables with no value at all. There are scenarios but are not so common.

### Assignation

If a variable was declared with `let`, you can update it:

```js
let count = 0;

if (someCondition) {
  count = count = 1;
}
```

We say that we **assign a new value** to the `count` variable. Again, it doesn't work with `const`:

```js live showConsole
const count = 0;

if (someCondition) {
  count = count = 1;
}
```

### Initialization

If you already know the initial value of your variable you can do both operations together. This is called **to initialize the variable**:

```js
const user = { name: 'Charlie Brown' };
let count = 0;
```
