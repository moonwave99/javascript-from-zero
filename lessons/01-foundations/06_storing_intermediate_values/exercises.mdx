## Recap Questions

<details>
  <summary>How do you initialize a variable in JavaScript?</summary>

By writing `const` followed by the desired variable name, then the equals sign, then the value we want to assign to the variable, e.g.:

```js
const myAge = 99;
const myName = 'Jane';
```

**Note:** this is not the only way, because JavaScript has also the `let` keyword. We'll get to that at the right time.

  <summary>What is the purpose of variables in programming?</summary>

They allow to store information in memory, and to retrieve it later. The information can be an explicit value, or the returned value from a function call, e.g.:

```js
const price = 50;
const discountedPrice = getDiscountedPrice(30, 50);
```

## Exercises

Given the following functions:

```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}

function squareRoot(n) {
  return Math.sqrt(n);
}
```

Use them to calculate the hypotenuse given the two other sides of the

Remember the **pythagorean theorem** to calculate the hypotenuse `c` given legs `a` and `b`: $c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

**Note**: the spirit of the exercise is to store the intermediate calculations in variables
