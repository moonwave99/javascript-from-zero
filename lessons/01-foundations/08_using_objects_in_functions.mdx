# Using objects in functions

In the [last lesson](./grouping_properties_together) we learnt how to group properties together as objects. Let's reinforce this idea by dealing with them in functions.

Our last example was printing some user information:

```js static showConsole
const user = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 7,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }  
};

console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 7 of Sesame Street'
```

If we need to print information for multiple users, we'd have to duplicate the number of log statements. That's nobueno, so what about writing a `printUserInfo` function? This time we are not interested in returning anything from the function so it's entirely fine to log from it.

:::important Note
We renamed the `user` variable to `myUser` in order not to make it clash with the function parameter. We'll elaborate in a moment.
:::

Let's see:

```js static showConsole
const myUser = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 7,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }  
};

function printUserInfo(user) {
  console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
  console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
  console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
  console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
}

printUserInfo(myUser);
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 7 of Sesame Street'
```

Great, we kept the same features as before! But why did we need to rename the user variable? Actually the code would have worked the same, but we cannot discuss why yet.
Functions should depend as much as possible on the passed arguments, that makes them predictable and easy to follow.

An example with two users will make things clearer for sure:

```js static showConsole
const myUser = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 7,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }  
};

const anotherUser = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'john@doe.com',
  age: 99,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 9,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }  
};

function printUserInfo(user) {
  console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
  console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
  console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
  console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
}

printUserInfo(myUser);
printUserInfo(anotherUser);
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 7 of Sesame Street'
'My name is John Doe'
'I am 99 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: john@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 9 of Sesame Street'
```

The `printUserInfo` function does not care where the passed objecs are stored. It just wants to deal with an argument that has `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, `email` and `address` properties.

Let's reinforce it even further:

```js static showConsole
function printUserInfo(user) {
  console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
  console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
  console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
  console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
}

printUserInfo({
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 7,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }
});
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 7 of Sesame Street'
```

Look ma, no `const` keyword in sight! We passed an object defined on the fly as an argument, without storing it in a variable before. We have done something similar with the `getDiscountedPrice` function before:

```js
console.log('The price for the nachos is', getDiscountedPrice(100, 20));
```

The `100` and `20` values are not stored in any variable as well! It just works the same for objects.

:::important Note
Passing arguments to functions is for some reason an hard topic to digest, especially when it involves more complex data structures. You are expected to be confused. The best advice is to practice it as much as possible, especially at early stages.
