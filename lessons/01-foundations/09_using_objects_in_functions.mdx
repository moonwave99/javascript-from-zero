# Using objects in functions

In the last two lessons we learnt how to group properties together as objects. We have also seen how objects can contain nested objects. Let's reinforce these concepts by dealing with them in functions.

We know how to print some user information:

```js static showConsole
const user = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 7,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }  
};

console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 7 of Sesame Street'
```

## Logging information from a function

If we need to print information for multiple users, we'd have to duplicate the number of log statements. That's nobueno, so what about writing a `printUserInfo` function? This time we are not interested in returning anything from the function so it's entirely fine to log from it.

:::important Note
We renamed the `user` variable to `myUser` in order not to make it clash with the function parameter. We'll elaborate in a moment.
:::

Let's see:

```js static showConsole
const myUser = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 7,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }  
};

function printUserInfo(user) {
  console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
  console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
  console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
  console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
}

printUserInfo(myUser);
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 7 of Sesame Street'
```

Great, we kept the same features as before! But why did we need to rename the user variable? Actually the code would have worked the same, but we cannot discuss why yet.
Functions should depend as much as possible on the passed arguments, that makes them predictable and easy to follow.

An example with two users will make things clearer for sure:

```js static showConsole
const firstUser = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 7,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }  
};

const secondUser = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'john@doe.com',
  age: 99,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 9,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }  
};

function printUserInfo(user) {
  console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
  console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
  console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
  console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
}

printUserInfo(firstUser);
printUserInfo(secondUser);
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 7 of Sesame Street'
'My name is John Doe'
'I am 99 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: john@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 9 of Sesame Street'
```

The `printUserInfo` function does not care where the passed objects are stored. It just wants to deal with an object that has `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, `email` and `address` properties.

Let's reinforce it even further:

```js static showConsole
function printUserInfo(user) {
  console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
  console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
  console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
  console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
}

printUserInfo({
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 7,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }
});
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 7 of Sesame Street'
```

Look ma, no `const` keyword in sight! We passed an object defined on the fly as an argument, without storing it in a variable before. We have done something similar with the `getDiscountedPrice` function before:

```js
console.log('The price for the nachos is', getDiscountedPrice(100, 20));
```

The `100` and `20` values are not stored in any variable as well! It just works the same for objects.

:::important Note
Passing arguments to functions is for some reason an hard topic to digest, especially when it involves more complex data structures. You are expected to be confused. The best advice is to practice it as much as possible, especially at early stages.
:::

## Checking if object properties are present

We have also seen [in a previous lesson](./nested_object#missing-keys) the problem that we face if the passed object is missing the `address` property. How can we be sure if such property is there?

```js static showConsole
const myUser = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'john@doe.com',
  age: 99,
};

function printUserInfo(user) {
  console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
  console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
  console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
  if (user.address) {
    console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
  }
}

printUserInfo(myUser);
// ** output **
'My name is John Doe'
'I am 99 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: john@doe.com'
```

No errors, no weird `undefined` mentions in the output. Let's run the updated code with Jane now:

```js static showConsole
const myUser = {
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  email: 'jane@doe.com',
  age: 35,
  address: {
    street: 'Sesame Street',
    number: 7,
    zipcode: '00040',
    city: 'Sin City'
  }  
};

function printUserInfo(user) {
  console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
  console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
  console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
  if (user.address) {
    console.log('You can visit me at the number', user.address.number, 'of', user.address.street);
  }
}

printUserInfo(myUser);
// ** output **
'My name is Jane Doe'
'I am 35 years old'
'Feel free to write me at: jane@doe.com'
'You can visit me at the number 7 of Sesame Street'
```

Thanks to the **if statement** the function can now decide whether to display the address information or not, avoiding error messages entirely.

What if we want to do something if an object property _is not there_? We have seen the **negation operator** with boolean values already. It is useful to check the absence of an object key as well:

```js static showConsole
const myUser = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 99,
};

function printUserInfo(user) {
  console.log('My name is', user.firstName, user.lastName);
  console.log('I am', user.age, 'years old');
  if (!user.email) {
    console.log('I am not reachable electronically unfortunately.')
  } else {
    console.log('Feel free to write me at:', user.email);
  }
}

printUserInfo(myUser);
// ** output **
'My name is John Doe'
'I am 99 years old'
'I am not reachable electronically unfortunately.'
```

Why does it work though? It's time to view how logic formally works in JavaScript, and we'll do it in the very next lesson.
