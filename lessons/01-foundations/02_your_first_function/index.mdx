# Your first function

In the [previous lesson](./printing_some_output) we have seen how to generate some output in the console. That's a fundamental tool: without it, we wouldn't be able to see any effect on our screens, and most important we wouldn't be able to make any observations along our path to knowledge.

In this lesson we'll introduce one of **the most important concepts in programming**, if not the most important at all! You won't be able to perceive such importance yet, but since it's also one of the hardest to digest, the sooner you familiarize with it, the better.

## Defining custom features

We already know how to print something out. It's the only thing we know actually.
Instead of the world, let's greet our friend Sally Brown this time:

```js static showConsole
console.log('Hello Sally Brown');
// ** output **
'Hello Sally Brown'
```

I apologise in advance for introducing some new syntax all at once.

```js static showConsole
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello Sally Brown');
}

greet();
// ** output **
'Hello Sally Brown'
```

What? `greet`? Why twice? What does `function` ever mean? And the `()` without anything in between, and that `{}` weird other set of brackets. Bear with me a second. First let's observe that there is no change in our output, we still read `'Hello Sally Brown'` in the console: it means we haven't introduced nor removed any feature in our original program, and that's a start.

Let's see what happens now:

```js static showConsole
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello Sally Brown');
}
// ** output **
```

Look ma no output! But how come if the `console.log` statement is still there? That's true indeed, but it look like that portion of code hasn't been run by the machine.

The difference between the two snippets is the `greet()` line at the end of the first one. We are close to the solution of the case! In the first example we did two things: we **defined** something and we **referenced it** right after. 

More rigorously:

- we **declared a new function**: `function greet() { ... }`;
- we **called** it right away: `greet()`.

We **call a function** in JavaScript by **writing its name** followed by **round parentheses**:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello Sally Brown');
}

  greet();
//^----^
//|    ‚åû round parentheses
//|
//‚åû name of the function
```

:::important Note
Actually this is the very first thing we have done in the course:

```js
console.log('Hello World!');
```

Exactly, `console.log` is a function! More precisely a **global function** that the language makes available to you. We'll come back to that later. Why are we not just writing `console.log()` then, but putting something in the parentheses? Well intuitively, we have to tell the machine _what_ to log. We say that we are **passing an argument to the function**, to better specify what we need. We'll dive into the matter in the very next lesson.
:::

We have quite some freedom in naming a function:

```js
function someVeryFunnyName() {
  // some code here
}
```

Spaces in the name are not allowed though, that's why if a function name contains multiple words, we capitalize those after the first. This convention is called [camel case][mdn:camel-case] be cause of the similarity of the capital letters to the humps of a camel's back üê™.

We can define as many functions as we need:

```js
function myFirstFunction() { ... }
function someOtherFunction() { ... }
function anotherFunctionWhyNot() { ... }
```

We can call the same function as many times as we need:

```js static showConsole
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello Sally Brown');
}

greet();
greet();
// ** output **
'Hello Sally Brown'
'Hello Sally Brown'
```

Let's stay a moment on this last example: we get twice the same output, even though there is only one `console.log` occurrence in the code. That is because we are calling `greet` twice. Calling a function is more or less like telling the machine _hey sis, can you please execute whatever is inside the function I am mentioning? Much appreciated!_.

The examples so far haven't been particularly exciting, I know. That's because we just know to log stuff. This is the last one for now, I promise!

```js static
function greetFriends() {
  console.log('Hello Sally Brown');
  console.log('Hello Charlie Brown');
}

greetFriends();
greetFriends();
// ** output **
'Hello Sally Brown'
'Hello Charlie Brown'
'Hello Sally Brown'
'Hello Charlie Brown'
```

Don't open the results yet! Can you guess the output?
